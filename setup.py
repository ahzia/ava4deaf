# Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention
# *************************************************************

# **Author**: `Sean Robertson <https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch>`_
# **Modified by**:Ahmad Zia Yousufi
# **For**:Global pytorch summer hackathon
# **Project**:AVA - toward a Machine Translation Platform for Deaf 
# we used the orignal notebook to implement a new idea,the idea is to translate English text to sign language using a neural network.
# ... to varying degrees of success.
# 
# This is made possible by the simple but powerful idea of the `sequence
# to sequence network <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, in which two
# recurrent neural networks work together to transform one sequence to
# another. An encoder network condenses an input sequence into a vector,
# and a decoder network unfolds that vector into a new sequence.
# 
# To improve upon this model we'll use an `attention mechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__, which lets the decoder
# learn to focus over a specific range of the input sequence.

# Loading data files
# ==================
# 
# The data for this project is a set of English to Sign Writing translation pairs.
# we gathered thes pairs from defrent sources like Sign Writing Wikipedia,SignPuddle website and some sign writing Books.

# Similar to the character encoding used in the character-level RNN
# tutorials, we will be representing each word in a language as a one-hot
# vector, or giant vector of zeros except for a single one (at the index
# of the word). 

# We'll need a unique index per word to use as the inputs and targets of
# the networks later. To keep track of all this we will use a helper class
# called ``Lang`` which has word → index (``word2index``) and index → word
# (``index2word``) dictionaries, as well as a count of each word
# ``word2count`` to use to later replace rare words.

# The Decoder
# -----------
# 
# The decoder is another RNN that takes the encoder output vector(s) and
# outputs a sequence of words to create the translation.
# 
#

# Simple Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# In the simplest seq2seq decoder we use only last output of the encoder.
# This last output is sometimes called the *context vector* as it encodes
# context from the entire sequence. This context vector is used as the
# initial hidden state of the decoder.
# 
# At every step of decoding, the decoder is given an input token and
# hidden state. The initial input token is the start-of-string ``<SOS>``
# token, and the first hidden state is the context vector (the encoder's
# last hidden state).

# to save space we'll be going straight for the gold and introducing the
# Attention Mechanism.

# Attention Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# If only the context vector is passed betweeen the encoder and decoder,
# that single vector carries the burden of encoding the entire sentence.
# 
# Attention allows the decoder network to "focus" on a different part of
# the encoder's outputs for every step of the decoder's own outputs. First
# we calculate a set of *attention weights*. These will be multiplied by
# the encoder output vectors to create a weighted combination. The result
# (called ``attn_applied`` in the code) should contain information about
# that specific part of the input sequence, and thus help the decoder
# choose the right output words.
# Calculating the attention weights is done with another feed-forward
# layer ``attn``, using the decoder's input and hidden state as inputs.
# Because there are sentences of all sizes in the training data, to
# actually create and train this layer we have to choose a maximum
# sentence length (input length, for encoder outputs) that it can apply
# to. Sentences of the maximum length will use all the attention weights,
# while shorter sentences will only use the first few.

# Training
# ========
# 
# Preparing Training Data
# -----------------------
# 
# To train, for each pair we will need an input tensor (indexes of the
# words in the input sentence) and target tensor (indexes of the words in
# the target sentence). While creating these vectors we will append the
# EOS token to both sequences.
# 
# 
# 

# In[41]:



# Training the Model
# ------------------
# 
# To train we run the input sentence through the encoder, and keep track
# of every output and the latest hidden state. Then the decoder is given
# the ``<SOS>`` token as its first input, and the last hidden state of the
# encoder as its first hidden state.
# 
# "Teacher forcing" is the concept of using the real target outputs as
# each next input, instead of using the decoder's guess as the next input.
# Using teacher forcing causes it to converge faster but `when the trained
# network is exploited, it may exhibit
# instability <http://minds.jacobs-university.de/sites/default/files/uploads/papers/ESNTutorialRev.pdf>`__.
# 
# You can observe outputs of teacher-forced networks that read with
# coherent grammar but wander far from the correct translation -
# intuitively it has learned to represent the output grammar and can "pick
# up" the meaning once the teacher tells it the first few words, but it
# has not properly learned how to create the sentence from the translation
# in the first place.
# 
# Because of the freedom PyTorch's autograd gives us, we can randomly
# choose to use teacher forcing or not with a simple if statement. Turn
# ``teacher_forcing_ratio`` up to use more of it.
